<!-- Exercise 3-1
This program uses a script to validate and confirm that a credit card number
only includes integers.  The script will also remove any dashes or spaces inputted
by the user.  After the script removes any spaces or dashes it will reject the credit card
number that the user has input if it contains any non-numeric characters.-->
